                On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
                Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
                thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
                would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn

                said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few
                insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe
                and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused
                her for their.
